## Branching heuristics

Goal is to decide which variable is going to be next decision variable. 
There are some basic approaches: simple, VSIDS, MTF.

### Simple

We could just pick first undefined variable. But we don't use any information about
problem, so it's not fast realization, but easy to understand or code.

### VSIDS

We start an array called `activity` that stores activity of every variable.
